Commenting out as a kindness to OWL DL users. The semantics didn't quite cover
our usage anyway, since (a) we want static-across-time, which is so beyond OWL as 
to be from another planet (b) we want identity reasoning invariant across xml:lang 
tagging. FOAF code will know what to do. OWL folks note, this assertion might return. -->
