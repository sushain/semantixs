* What is SEMANTIXS and what can it do for me ?
<br/><br/>
SEMANTIXS is a semantic information extraction system that can extract, represent and visualize domain-specific knowledge from free-text in the form of complex (and simple)
relationships. It does this by applying rule-based extraction algorithms to free-text and identifying key entities and
relations, referring to certain background knowledge that's given as input, validating the extracted constructs in light of this background knowlede 
in order to achieve coherent results as per the given domain and finally, representing the results in the form of RDF graph(s), which can be analyzed using 
an in-built visualizer.
<br/><br/><hr/><br/>
* Ok, so I've some text and I want to extract whatever information I can get. What to do ?
<br/><br/>
You can test SEMANTIXS on any text without uploading anything by setting Analysis Complexity to level 3
before processing. With this setting, SEMANTIXS behaves opportunistically and simply tries to extract  
as much information as it can, learning new relationships and concepts along the way.
<br/><br/><hr/><br/>
* Nice. I want to know more about what SEMANTIXS can do. What should I upload before trying to process text and what difference does it make ?
<br/><br/>
You can test SEMANTIXS on any text without uploading anything, by setting Analysis Complexity to level 3.
However, in levels 1 and 2, SEMANTIXS expects a file in .rdf format as input, which
defines the domain of the text. In most cases, this would mean that your .rdf file
is expected to contain the domain ontology (TBOX: class concepts  + relationships) as well
as instance assertions (A-BOX) that you expect in text. SEMANTIXS then works within your domain and doesn't try to extract any information thats not relevant to your description
as defined in the uploaded .rdf file.
<br/><br/><hr/><br/>
* Well, I've a domain ontology, but I don't have instance data, or my ontology doesn't cover all the relationships that I would ideally want for my domain. What should I do ?
<br/><br/>
Try setting Analysis Complexity to level 2 or 3. With these settings, SEMANTIXS sacrifices some correctness for exploring wilderness in trying to enrich the given ontology by learning new relationships as it reads text.
It also utilizes some pre-generated instance data (for eg., FOAF) in addition to the given ontology for acquiring knowledge, however in the current version, 
it won't attempt to automatically map those instances to the input ontology; instead, it'll retain their original references and uri's.
<br/><br/><hr/><br/>
* Overall, it seems pretty cool. I want to know more about what's going on inside. Where can I learn all that ?
<br/><br/>
